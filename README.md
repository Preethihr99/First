# Transfer-Certificate

A Simple Transfer Certificate for PU student :-

This Webpage for Transfer Certificate is created as part of my interest during learning of HTML. It is just a prototype of Transfer Certificate given to PU students by 
Government of Karnataka. It involves image of Department of pre-university Education.
The webpage collects all the required information from the client and prints it.

This can be implemented in future by storing details to Database and connecting to printer etc.

Output of the HTML code is as below :
